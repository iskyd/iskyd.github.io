I'm not saying I'm batman, I'm just saying nobody has ever seen me and batman in a room together.

Other than saving Gotham at night I'm a Software Engineer in love with Data Science, Maths, Space, Bitcoin and Startups. Currently I'm Backend Engineer at Conio inc, an italian scale-up that is changing the Bitcoin's world. Previously I was Lead AI Engineer at nCore HR. I have a degree in Statistics and Big Data and I will have a degree in Maths or Phisics (I just made the first year): well that's a promise to myself. I'm tech reviewer at Pact for Julia books.

I have co-founded PlayLife Events, a tech startup based in Italy that provide an easy way to manage and sell tickets for events. ATM the project is dead (I will write an article about it). I am now working on Skretch, a new business idea that I can't talk now. I am also trying to contribute to the open source ecosystem of Julia: Wasabi.jl, Validator.jl, Bip39.jl and SurrealDB.jl are the main projects that I'm maintaining.

Here you can read about Julia, Docker, Kubernetes, Bitcoin, Artificial Intelligence, Startups and lot more.
